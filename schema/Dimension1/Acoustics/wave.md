For this test case, the density $\rho$ and the momentum $q$ read

$$
\rho(t, x) = \sin(\xi x)\cos(\omega t),
\quad
q(t, x) = - c \cos(\xi x)\sin(\omega t),
$$

where $\omega = \xi c$.

In order to avoid the problem of the boundary conditions, the wave number $\xi$ is adapted to the domain length:

$$
\xi = \frac{2\pi k}{x_{\text{max}}-x_{\text{min}}},
$$

where $k$ is a positive integer, $x_{\text{min}}$ and $x_{\text{max}}$ the left and right bounds of the domain.
